        <h1>Tips and tricks to stay positive</h1>
        <p class="quote"> I am pretty sure when everyone got to know about work from home, everyone got very excited. People
		could work from indoors, working in pj’s and spending more time with family.  But as soon as the days passed, I
		started feeling lethargic and found no motivation to work. The idea of working from home eventually started sucking
		and I didn’t feel like working anymore, procrastinated every other task. I started missing my friends, going out for
		dinner, watching movies. Nothing seemed normal. </p>
		<p class="quote">
I started realizing if this continues, my productivity is going to decrease, so I needed a plan to bring my life back on
 track. Here are few things that helped me to be back on track. </p><p class="quote">
<h5>1) Set your daily plans</h5>
Setting your plans on a daily basis is a real game changer. It’s very much easy to get distracted when at home like the TV, 
your children, your pets, etc. But if you a have a plan, you are more likely to stick around with the plan. Also, have a habit
 of writing important tasks in a diary so you don’t miss out on important task for the day. In this way, your vision will be
 clear and your work will be on track. </p>
 <p class="quote">

<h5>2)	Exercise</h5>
Invest your time in a regular workout. It not just helps you maintain your body, but also helps boosting the energy and
 maintaining good mood which thereby leads to stay positive throughout the day and achieve your targeted goals. Work out at
 least 3-4 times per week with a proper diet.</p>
 <p class="quote">

<h5>3)	Have a me time</h5>
Having me time is as important as anything else in this world. When you start giving time for yourself, your mind 
automatically starts talking, it starts questioning. You start thinking about the dreams you are chasing and exactly how can
 you conquer those dreams.  It helps in relaxing and recharging your body which is very essential. </p>
 <p class="quote">

<h5>4)	Hobby</h5>
Take some time out for your hobbies. Try experimenting new things as and when needed. It helps in refreshing your mood and 
opens up for new things to do which we might miss out a big time. Playing with your hobbies helps increasing your productivity because then you don’t stick to your daily boring routine.
</p>
<p class="quote">Hopefully, these tips will help you to achieve the productive day you want and feel less lethargic.</p>
